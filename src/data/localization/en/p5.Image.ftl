description__0 = Creates a new <a href="#/p5.Image">p5.Image</a>. A <a href="#/p5.Image">p5.Image</a> is a canvas backed representation of an image.
description__1 = p5 can display .gif, .jpg and .png images. Images may be displayed in 2D and 3D space. Before an image is used, it must be loaded with the <a href="#/p5/loadImage">loadImage()</a> function. The <a href="#/p5.Image">p5.Image</a> class contains fields for the width and height of the image, as well as an array called <a href="#/p5.Image/pixels">pixels[]</a> that contains the values for every pixel in the image.
description__2 = The methods described below allow easy access to the image's pixels and alpha channel and simplify the process of compositing.
description__3 = Before using the <a href="#/p5.Image/pixels">pixels[]</a> array, be sure to use the <a href="#/p5.Image/loadPixels">loadPixels()</a> method on the image to make sure that the pixel data is properly loaded.
params__width = Number
params__height = Number
width__description__0 = Image width.
height__description__0 = Image height.
pixels__description__0 = Array containing the values for all the pixels in the display window. These values are numbers. This array is the size (include an appropriate factor for pixelDensity) of the display window x4, representing the R, G, B, A values in order for each pixel, moving from left to right across each row, then down each column. Retina and other high density displays may have more pixels (by a factor of pixelDensity^2). For example, if the image is 100Ã—100 pixels, there will be 40,000. With pixelDensity = 2, there will be 160,000. The first four values (indices 0-3) in the array will be the R, G, B, A values of the pixel at (0, 0). The second four values (indices 4-7) will contain the R, G, B, A values of the pixel at (1, 0). More generally, to set values for a pixel at (x, y): <pre><code class="language-javascript">let d = pixelDensity(); for (let i = 0; i < d; i++) {"{"}  for (let j = 0; j < d; j++) {"{"}  // loop over  index = 4 * ((y * d + j) * width * d + (x * d + i));  pixels[index] = r;  pixels[index+1] = g;  pixels[index+2] = b;  pixels[index+3] = a;  {"}"} {"}"}</code></pre>
pixels__description__1 = Before accessing this array, the data must loaded with the <a href="#/p5.Image/loadPixels">loadPixels()</a> function. After the array data has been modified, the <a href="#/p5.Image/updatePixels">updatePixels()</a> function must be run to update the changes.

set__params__y = Number: y-coordinate of the pixel
set__params__a = Number|Number[]|Object: grayscale value | pixel array |  a <a href="#/p5.Color">p5.Color</a> | image to copy
resize__description__0 = Resize the image to a new width and height. To make the image scale proportionally, use 0 as the value for the wide or high parameter. For instance, to make the width of an image 150 pixels, and change the height using the same proportion, use resize(150, 0).
resize__params__width = Number: the resized image width
resize__params__height = Number: the resized image height
copy__description__0 = Copies a region of pixels from one image to another. If no srcImage is specified this is used as the source. If the source and destination regions aren't the same size, it will automatically resize source pixels to fit the specified target region.

filter__description__0 = Applies an image filter to a <a href="#/p5.Image">p5.Image</a>

filter__description__3 = OPAQUE Sets the alpha channel to entirely opaque. No parameter is used.
filter__description__4 = INVERT Sets each pixel to its inverse value. No parameter is used.
filter__description__5 = POSTERIZE Limits each channel of the image to the number of colors specified as the parameter. The parameter can be set to values between 2 and 255, but results are most noticeable in the lower ranges.
filter__description__6 = BLUR Executes a Gaussian blur with the level parameter specifying the extent of the blurring. If no parameter is used, the blur is equivalent to Gaussian blur of radius 1. Larger values increase the blur.
filter__description__7 = ERODE Reduces the light areas. No parameter is used.
filter__description__8 = DILATE Increases the light areas. No parameter is used.
filter__description__9 = filter() does not work in WEBGL mode. A similar effect can be achieved in WEBGL mode using custom shaders. Adam Ferriss has written a <a href="https://github.com/aferriss/p5jsShaderExamples" target='_blank'>selection of shader examples</a> that contains many of the effects present in the filter examples.
