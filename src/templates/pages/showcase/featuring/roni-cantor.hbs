      <h3 class='project-q'>What are you up to?</h3>
      <p class='project-a'>I just graduated from Ryerson University's New Media program. Coming from 4 years of coding and making robots, I decided to take a break and play with some more traditional forms of art—while still coding and playing with robots.</p>
      
      <h3 class='project-q'>How did you get started with p5.js?</h3>
      <p class='project-a'>I first started using p5.js at <a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/camp2019/" target="_blank">NYU ITP Camp</a>! After using <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> for many years, I wanted to try something new.</p>
      
      <h3 class='project-q'>How did you use p5.js in this project?</h3>
      <p class='project-a'>I used p5.js in this project to generate the sine wave and lerp (linear interpolation) formulas and display the visuals in the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js Web Editor</a>. I then used a feature in my code that exported my programmed graphic into an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG" target="_blank">SVG</a> file. I needed an SVG file to give to the plotter—an <a href="https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/846" target="_blank">AxiDraw V3</a>—so that it understood where to draw the lines that I programmed. I sent this information to the plotter with a program called <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a>!</p>
      
      <h3 class='project-q'>What's your favorite p5.js feature?</h3>
      <p class='project-a'><code><a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/lerp" target="_blank">lerp()</a></code> because lines are fun and "lerp" is a fun word to say!</p>
      
      <h3 class='project-q'>Did you face any challenges working on this project? If so, how did you overcome them?</h3>
      <p class='project-a'>It was my first time using p5.js, Inkscape, and a plotter! I really benefited from the people around me who had used p5 before, as well as online guides and forums.</p>
      
      <h3 class='project-q'>What's a cool thing we should check out?</h3>
      <p class='project-a'><a href="https://www.instagram.com/gandyworks/" target="_blank">@gandyworks</a> on Instagram—super cool analog plotter stuff.</p>
      
      <h3 class='project-q'>Where can people learn more about you?</h3>
